# Skills-Record

you can download different versions of Anaconda in https://repo.continuum.io/

The Anaconda official has sealed up the image library of Tsinghua. 
You can change the image source of conda into that of CUST 

```
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free/
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes
```

It's still work.

intsall opencv
```
conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
```

最近是真滴烦
